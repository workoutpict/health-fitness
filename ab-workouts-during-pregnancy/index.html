<p>It is one of the safest abdominal exercises to do during pregnancy. Sciacca says this pregnancy ab workout can be done during all trimesters—and even daily—as long as you have the energy and feel well supported during the exercise.

As a general rule, avoid exercises that mimic a “crunching” motion and anything that pushes you to the point of strain or loss of control.</p>
