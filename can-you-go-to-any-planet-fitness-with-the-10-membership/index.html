<p>With the classic $10 or $15 memberships, you would be able to access any location for the day with a $5 franchise fee. I was wondering if there is any catch in planet fitness claim of $10/month cost of gym membership ( year long commitment, extra charges, hidden charges or insisting on providing credit card or bank account information)? Thus $10 a month turns into $39 a year plus the cost of 11 additional months unless you can get out of the annual commitment, which seems unlikely based on an faq on planet fitness’ site: Yeah, planet fitness will charge you $40 when you get your membership.</p>
