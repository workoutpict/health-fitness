<p>Running on the treadmill for 20 minutes on a steep incline will get your heart pumping, and dropping back on lower inclines for a recovery period makes this an effective fat burning. Decrease speed to intensity 5. Talking about incline, working out on an inclined treadmill is a great way to burn fat. When it comes to consistently burning calories regardless of the weather and without putting too much impact on your joints, the treadmill is hard to beat.</p>

<p>For the third minute, take it easy and decrease the speed to between 2 to 3 miles per hour. When it comes to consistently burning calories regardless of the weather and without putting too much impact on your joints, the treadmill is hard to beat. At the end of your workout, reduce the speed back to an easy pace for a three minute cooldown. Running on the treadmill for 20 minutes on a steep incline will get your heart pumping, and dropping back on lower inclines for a recovery period makes this an effective fat burning. I typically like to respond to emails or watch youtube videos when i’m on the treadmill to truly maximize my time. Though it might not be for everyone (hill workouts are very intense), training at a raised incline is very effective, because it allows you to get your heart rate up to a higher level at lower speeds.</p>
