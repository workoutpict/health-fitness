<p>Cardio power and resistance dura un poco menos que otras rutinas, dura unos 39 minutos, pero no te hagas ilusiones, porque el entrenamiento hace honor a su nombre, poder cardio y resistencia, y cada minuto estarás trabajando a tope. So after the day off, sean t has cardio power and resistance for me.so the same workout from day 3, and this didn�t get any easier. If you ask me, it felt like the plyometric workout that i did yesterday….basically, it required a lot of me, and it was hard 🙂 here’s beachbody’s description of cardio power &amp; resistance: Cardio power &amp; resistance wasn’t as cardio centric as the plyometric workout, it focused more on working out the legs, chest and shoulders. Don’t get me wrong i was still dying and i still took a lot of breaks but the workout itself was very enjoyable. Today’s workout brings me to cardio power &amp; resistance.</p>
