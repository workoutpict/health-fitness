<p>Surfing is a demanding sport. A lot of surf research suggests we use our trapezius, rectus abdominis, latissimus dorsi, obliques, triceps, biceps and deltoids. Although you can easily kitesurf without being an athletic person at all, kitesurfing can give you a very intense workout depending on wind and water conditions and on your riding style. Those who surf need core strength nearly as strong as the greek gods’, which somehow seems to work when they stand naked in front of ancient manuscripts. In fact, surfing is a great workout. Now i know the key to getting better at surfing is “surf no matter what”.and stab law #001 tells us “you wont get better at surfing by going to the gym”.</p>
