<p>I think the black card is worth it because you get $1 bottles of water (adds up over time), and access to the sauna/spa rooms. Guests must be at least 18 years old. If a guest is between 13 and 17 years old, they are invited to visit accompanied by a parent or guardian. You can grab a planet fitness black card by paying a nominal initiation fee of $1.00 and a yearly fee of $39.00.
